## Lisp attempt

Not really lisp though, but rather a clojure-like representation of lambda calculus. This is a hobby project to teach myself some functional programming basics.

The first goal was to define the factorial function. This seems to work now, see [LambdaTest](https://github.com/h908714124/lisp-attempt/blob/master/src/test/java/com/mypack/eval/LambdaTest.java) and [fact.clj](https://github.com/h908714124/lisp-attempt/blob/master/src/lisp/fact.clj).
