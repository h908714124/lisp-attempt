## (((Lisp)))

Not really lisp though, just lisp flavoured lambda calculus. This is a hobby project to teach myself some lambda calculus basics.

The first goal was to define the factorial function and apply it to `2`. This seems to work now, see [LambdaTest](https://github.com/h908714124/lisp-attempt/blob/master/src/test/java/com/mypack/eval/LambdaTest.java).
